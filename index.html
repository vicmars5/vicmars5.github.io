Some of those projects were using SASS, or CSS in JS. </li> </ul> </div> <h3> Software Developer Intern <small><a href=https://skycatch.com> Skycatch </a></small> </h3> <div> May 2017 - December 2018 </div> <div class=description> Worked in many projects with different responsibilities: <ul> <li> Skycatch map viewer. Worked improving the user experience in a project with really old legacy cold, using AngularJS as a web framework. Some of the modules were built using NodeJS 0.10.x. </li> <li> EDGE1 (The main product of the company): EDGE1 is an IoT device deployed in extremest conditions environment with no internet and poor 3G signal. Worked improving the user experience of the app and have the frontend ownership for 6 months, and worked another 6 in different tasks. Web technologies: React, Redux, Socket IO. Also helped in the backend helping with shell injection issues and improving how we transferred files.

The backend stack was made with Koa + MongoDB, and the frontend over React-Native with Redux and Axios. Deploy system with Git Hooks + Shell + Docker in a Linux server hosted on Digital Ocean. Also configured NGINX with SSL auto renewal. </p> <h3> JR Software Engineer <small> Kett Electronics </small> </h3> <div> April 2016 - May 2017 </div> <p> Worked in a home automation system for CONACYT. The project was built over a Raspberry PI, in a NodeJS server. It involved to manipulate relays via GPIO, read environment temperature and humidity through I2C and luminosity through SPI. Also, set up a to stream video from a security camera. The backend was made over NodeJS, Express, SocketIO, and MongoDB. The frontend was made with JQuery and SocketIO in the first version, after that, I made a rewrite in Vue. </p> </div> <h2 class="mb-4 border-bottom pb-2">Education</h2> <div class="pl-4 pb-3"> <h3> IT Engineering <small><a href=http://www.udg.mx/ > Universidad de Guadalajara </a></small> </h3> <p> August 2015 - December 2019 (8 semesters complete) </p> <h3> Programer Specialization <small><a href=http://www.cetis127.edu.mx/portal/ > CETis 127 (Highschool) </a></small> </h3> <p> August 2012 - June 2015 </p> </div> <h2 class="mb-4 border-bottom pb-2">Languages</h2> <div class=pl-4> <h3> Spanish </h3> <p> Native language. </p> </div> <div class="pl-4 pb-3"> <h3> English </h3> <p> Fluent </p> </div> <h2 class="mb-4 border-bottom pb-2"> Coding Skills</h2> <div class=pl-4> <h3> NodeJS </h3> <p> I have a long time coding JavaScript on NodeJS, since I was 17 (5 years ago). Deep knowledge in how the NodeJS execution queue works. Even I have wrote some NodeJS modules in C++ (You can see my GDL JS talk demo about that native add-ons). </p> </div> <div class=pl-4> <h3> Frontend Development </h3> <p> I have worked in many frontend apps using Vue, React and AngularJS, and experience with different design patterns like MVC and Flux. I have a long time making use of SASS and have a good knowledge of the power of this tool (iterators, lists, and hash maps). </p> </div> <div class=pl-4> <h3> Linux Systems </h3> <p> I have worked with Linux systems for a long time ago. Also automated deployments using SSH + GIT + Docker, that requires a good understanding of how SSH works, and what should be changed in the server config. Have some knowledge in SHELL to build and deploy Docker images, when repos are changed in the server. </p> </div> <div class=pl-4> <h3> UX/UI </h3> <p> I have worked in many projects refining UX/UI, also have read many books about the subject like “The Design of Everyday Things”. The reason is that I give a lot of importance that every detail I code will look as expected and really help to make the life of the user easier. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <script type="text/javascript" src="index.735be8715b23716a9e0e.js"></script></body> </html>
